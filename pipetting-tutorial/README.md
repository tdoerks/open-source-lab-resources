## 📖 The Four Steps

### Step 1: Push to First Stop
**Description**: Press the plunger button down to the first resistance point. This expels any air from the tip, preparing it to draw liquid.

**What you see**:
- Plunger moves down ~25% of travel
- Tip remains empty
- No liquid movement yet

**Why it's important**: Ensures accurate volume by removing air before aspiration

---

### Step 2: Insert Into Liquid
**Description**: While holding the plunger at the first stop, lower the pipette tip into the sample liquid. Immerse 2-3mm below surface.

**What you see**:
- Tube appears with liquid
- Pipette tip enters the liquid
- Plunger stays at first stop
- No aspiration yet

**Why it's important**: Proper depth prevents air bubbles and ensures complete aspiration

---

### Step 3: Slowly Release Plunger
**Description**: Gently and smoothly release the plunger back to the resting position. This draws liquid into the tip through vacuum suction.

**What you see**:
- Plunger moves up to resting position
- Liquid fills the tip (red/orange color)
- Liquid level in source tube drops slightly

**Why it's important**: Slow, steady release ensures accurate volume and prevents bubble formation

---

### Step 4: Dispense - First Stop, Then Second Stop
**Description**: Move to your target location. Push to first stop to dispense the volume, then continue pushing past the first stop to the second stop (full depression) to expel any remaining liquid.

**What you see**:
- Plunger moves to first stop (partial dispense)
- Then continues to second stop (complete dispense)
- Liquid transfers from tip to receiving tube
- Tip becomes empty

**Why it's important**: The "blowout" (second stop) ensures complete transfer of the intended volume

## 💡 Pipetting Best Practices

### Before Pipetting
- ✅ Choose the correct pipette for your volume range
- ✅ Inspect the pipette for damage
- ✅ Ensure tip is securely attached
- ✅ Pre-wet the tip for viscous liquids (aspirate and dispense 2-3 times)

### During Pipetting
- ✅ Hold the pipette vertically
- ✅ Use slow, smooth plunger movements
- ✅ Immerse tip 2-3mm below liquid surface
- ✅ Pause briefly after aspiration before removing tip
- ✅ Touch tip to wall when dispensing (for better accuracy)

### After Pipetting
- ✅ Eject tips into proper waste
- ✅ Return pipette to stand
- ✅ Store pipettes at highest volume setting
- ✅ Never lay pipettes down horizontally with liquid in tip

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Pushing past first stop during aspiration (draws in too much)
- ❌ Releasing plunger too quickly (creates bubbles, inaccurate volume)
- ❌ Not inserting tip deep enough (aspirates air)
- ❌ Tilting the pipette while aspirating
- ❌ Using damaged or incorrect tips
- ❌ Forgetting the "blowout" (second stop) when dispensing

## 🎓 Teaching Use Cases

### Laboratory Training
**Scenario**: New research assistant starting in the lab

**Approach**:
1. Have trainee watch complete animation first
2. Then work through step-by-step tutorial together
3. Discuss each step and why it's important
4. Practice with water before working with samples
5. Use tutorial as reference during practice

### Classroom Teaching
**Scenario**: Teaching pipetting to biology class

**Approach**:
1. Project step-by-step tutorial on screen
2. Demonstrate with actual pipette alongside animation
3. Have students follow along with their pipettes
4. Pause at each step for questions
5. Students can review complete animation at home

### Self-Learning
**Scenario**: Student learning independently

**Approach**:
1. Start with step-by-step tutorial
2. Read each description carefully
3. Watch animation multiple times
4. Take notes on key points
5. Practice with water and dye
6. Use complete animation for quick refreshers

### Remote Training
**Scenario**: Training remote lab members

**Approach**:
1. Share HTML file via email or link
2. Have trainee watch and take notes
3. Video call to discuss and demonstrate
4. Trainee practices and sends video of technique
5. Provide feedback and corrections

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Animation won't play
**Solutions**:
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Try a different browser
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors

### Visual elements overlap
**Solutions**:
- Make browser window larger
- Zoom out (Ctrl + -)
- Use desktop browser instead of mobile
- Rotate tablet to landscape

### Can't click buttons
**Solutions**:
- Wait for previous animation to complete
- Refresh page to reset state
- Try different mouse/touchpad
- Check if popup blocker is interfering
