## 1. PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the proper methods for defrosting laboratory freezers to maintain optimal performance, ensure proper temperature control, and preserve sample integrity. Regular defrosting prevents excessive ice buildup that can compromise freezer efficiency, reduce storage capacity, and lead to temperature fluctuations.

## 2. SCOPE

This SOP applies to all laboratory freezers including:
- -20°C upright and chest freezers
- -80°C ultra-low temperature freezers
- Walk-in cold rooms and freezers

This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for freezer maintenance and sample management.

## 3. RESPONSIBILITIES

- **Laboratory Manager:** Overall responsibility for scheduling and oversight of defrosting activities
- **Designated Personnel:** Responsible for performing defrosting procedures according to this SOP
- **All Lab Members:** Responsible for maintaining organized freezer storage and minimizing unnecessary door openings
- **Equipment Technician:** Responsible for addressing any equipment malfunctions identified during defrosting

## 4. DEFINITIONS

- **Defrosting:** The process of removing accumulated ice and frost from freezer interior surfaces
- **Cold Chain:** Maintaining appropriate temperature throughout sample handling and storage
- **Recovery Time:** The time required for a freezer to return to target temperature after defrosting
- **Critical Samples:** Samples that cannot tolerate temperature excursions above their storage temperature

## 5. DEFROSTING FREQUENCY

### 5.1 Scheduled Defrosting

| Freezer Type | Recommended Frequency | Ice Buildup Threshold |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| -20°C Freezers | Every 6-12 months | >1/4 inch (6 mm) |
| -80°C Freezers | Every 12-24 months | >1/2 inch (12 mm) |
| Walk-in Freezers | Annually | As needed |

### 5.2 Unscheduled Defrosting Triggers

Defrost immediately if any of the following occur:
- Ice buildup prevents door from closing properly
- Door gasket seal is compromised by ice
- Temperature alarm activates repeatedly
- Ice buildup exceeds threshold levels
- Visible frost on stored samples or boxes

### 5.3 Scheduling Considerations

- Schedule defrosting during periods of low laboratory activity (weekends, holidays)
- Provide 48-72 hours advance notice to all laboratory personnel
- Avoid scheduling during critical experiments or sample storage periods
- Consider ambient temperature (avoid summer heat waves if possible)

## 6. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT

### 6.1 Required Materials

- [ ] Insulated coolers or storage bins
- [ ] Dry ice (estimate 5-10 lbs per hour of defrost time per cooler)
- [ ] Plastic ice scrapers (DO NOT use metal tools)
- [ ] Absorbent towels and mops
- [ ] Bucket or container for water collection
- [ ] 70% ethanol or approved laboratory cleaner
- [ ] Spray bottles
- [ ] Disposable gloves and safety goggles
- [ ] Thermometers (calibrated)
- [ ] "Out of Service" signage

### 6.2 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

- Insulated gloves (for handling dry ice and cold items)
- Safety goggles
- Lab coat
- Closed-toe shoes (slip-resistant if possible)

## 7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

### 7.1 Hazards

⚠️ **Cold Burns:** Dry ice (-78.5°C/-109.3°F) and frozen materials can cause severe cold burns. Always wear insulated gloves.

⚠️ **Asphyxiation:** Dry ice sublimes to carbon dioxide gas. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Never use dry ice in enclosed spaces without adequate ventilation.

⚠️ **Slip Hazard:** Water from defrosting creates slip hazards. Place absorbent materials around freezer and post wet floor signs.

⚠️ **Electrical Hazard:** Water and electricity are dangerous. Keep water away from electrical components.

⚠️ **Sample Loss:** Improper handling can result in sample thawing or degradation. Maintain cold chain at all times.

- Clear sufficient space for samples
- Label backup storage area with "TEMPORARY - DEFROST IN PROGRESS"
- Have cart or transport containers ready

**OPTION B: Temporary Dry Ice Storage**
- Line coolers with towels
- Add dry ice to bottom of each cooler (2-3 inches)
- Place cardboard or plastic barrier over dry ice
- Label each cooler clearly with date and contents

**Step 7:** Transfer samples

**If using OPTION A (Backup Freezer):**
- Work quickly but carefully
- Group samples by project/user if possible
- Record which samples are in which backup location
- Verify backup freezer maintains stable temperature
- Close backup freezer door securely

**If using OPTION B (Dry Ice Coolers):**
- Work quickly but carefully
- Group samples by project/user if possible
- Record which samples are in which cooler
- Monitor temperature of temporary storage (should maintain <-20°C)
- Place additional dry ice on top if needed
- Close cooler lids securely

⏱️ **Time Limit:** Complete sample transfer within 30 minutes to minimize temperature excursion

**Step 8:** Verify all samples transferred
- Check all shelves, drawers, and door storage
- Ensure no samples remain in freezer
- Remove all racks, shelves, and accessories

### 8.3 Defrosting Process

**Step 9:** Initiate defrosting
- Turn off freezer power (if recommended by manufacturer), OR
- Set to defrost mode (if available)
- Prop door open securely (ensure it cannot close accidentally)
- Post "OUT OF SERVICE - DEFROSTING IN PROGRESS" sign

**Step 10:** Place water collection system
- Place absorbent towels around freezer base

- Optional: Use fan to circulate air (DO NOT use heat!)
- Monitor water collection and replace towels as needed
- DO NOT use sharp objects to chip ice (can damage freezer)
- DO NOT use hot water or heat guns

⏱️ **Estimated Time:**
- -20°C freezers: 4-8 hours

- Note any issues for maintenance follow-up

### 8.5 Restart and Recovery

**Step 17:** Restart freezer
- Ensure interior is completely dry
- Close door securely
- Turn on power (if turned off)
- Set temperature to target setting:

**Step 18:** Monitor temperature recovery
- Check temperature periodically during recovery period
- Record temperatures on monitoring log
- DO NOT return samples until target temperature reached and stabilized

⏱️ **Recovery Time:**
- -20°C freezers: 2-4 hours to reach -20°C
- -80°C freezers: 4-8 hours to reach -80°C (may take 12-24 hours to fully stabilize)

**Step 19:** Verify stable temperature over 24-48 hours
- Allow freezer to run for **24-48 hours** after reaching target temperature
- Check temperature at least once daily during stabilization period
- Temperature should remain stable within ±2°C of target
- This extended period ensures the freezer can maintain temperature long-term

- Organize samples systematically
- Update inventory/mapping system
- Verify all samples accounted for

**Step 22:** Final verification
- Close door securely
- Verify freezer maintaining temperature
- Remove "OUT OF SERVICE" signs
- Notify laboratory personnel that freezer is back in service

### 8.7 Post-Defrosting Documentation

**Step 23:** Complete defrosting log (see Section 9)
- Record all required information
- Attach any photos or notes
- Sign and date

**Step 24:** File documentation
- Place completed log in equipment binder
- Update digital records (if applicable)
- Schedule next defrosting date

**Step 25:** Dispose of materials properly
